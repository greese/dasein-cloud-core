 * The Dasein Cloud API divides exceptional conditions into two groups: cloud exceptions and internal
 * exception. A cloud exception is simply an error that occurs in the cloud, whereas an internal
 * exception is one that occurs on the localhost within the implementation of this API for
 * a particular provider. This distinction can help clients determine how to recover from any
 * given error.
