/**
 * Services for retrieving IP addresses managed independently from virtual machines and 
 * load balancers. Dasein Cloud supports two kinds of address management:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Assigned</li>
 * <li>Forwarded</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Assigned addresses are those that are assigned to a virtual machine. The mechanism (NAT vs.
 * direct NIC assignment) is not relevant. With assigned addresses like AWS Elastic IPs, all
 * traffic for that IP addresses on any port is routed to the assigned server. Clouds may
 * supported assigned public IP addresses, private IPs, both, or neither.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Forwarded IP addresses enable you to specify IP forwarding rules on an IP address that may vary
 * based on the port in question. On the same IP address, you could forward traffic for the SMTP
 * port to one server and traffic for the HTTP port to another server. An example of a forwarding
 * cloud is ReliaCloud. Only public IP addresses may do forwarding.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clouds may also support client requests for new IP addresses.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: In many clouds, the {@link IpAddress#getProviderIpAddressId()} has the same value
 * as the {@link IpAddress#getAddress()}. Do not make the mistake of treating them as 
 * interchangeable values as in some clouds the unique ID is in fact different. Where Dasein
 * Cloud asks for an address ID, use the ID. Where it asks for the numeric IP address, provide
 * the numeric IP address.</i>
